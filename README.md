# SlideBuilder

This is a utility application used for building web-based 
slides shows. It uses the The StAX XML parser to read 
proprietary xml files and convert them to html pages and 
JavaScript scripts. 

The files are of minimal size and make the development of
slide show take a 10th of the time.
