    <h1 style="font-family: Times; font-size: 1.3em">CSS II</h1>

    In this section, we will be covering how to use CSS to create responsive layouts. We will cover how to do this
    with vanilla CSS, then talk about the Bootstrap Framework.
    <br/> <br/>

    As we go through this section, the following definitions will be useful:
    <br/>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>fixed layout:</b>
            the layout is specified in hardcoded pixel values
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>fluid layout:</b>
            the layout is specified in percentages, but does not change based on screen size
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>responsive layout:</b>
            the layout uses media queries to change based on screen size
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1 id="media_queries">Media Queries</h1>

    <bullet>
        What are Media Queries?
    </bullet>

    <bullet>
        Media queries are a feature of <b>CSS3</b> allowing content rendering to adapt to different conditions such as
        screen resolution.
    </bullet>

    <bullet>
        What is CSS3?
    </bullet>

    <bullet>
        CSS3 is the latest evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets language and aims at extending CSS2.
        It brings a lot of long-awaited novelties, like rounded corners, shadows, gradients, transitions or
        animations, as well as new layouts like multi-columns, flexible box or grid layouts.
    </bullet>

    <bullet>
        What are Media Queries primarily used to do?
    </bullet>

    <bullet>
        Media Queries are primarily used to accomplish <b>Responsive Web Design</b>.

    <bullet>
        What is Responsive Web Design?
    </bullet>

    <bullet>
        Responsive web design is an approach to web design that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices
        and window or screen sizes.
    </bullet>

        Take note of the meta tag named <b>"viewport"</b>!
    </bullet>

    <br/>
    <h1 id="viewport">Viewport</h1>

    <bullet>
        What is The Viewport?
    </bullet>

    <bullet>
        The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.
    </bullet>

    <bullet>
        HTML5 introduced a method to let web designers take control over the viewport, through the |||ltmeta> tag.
    </bullet>

    <bullet>
        <b>EXAMPLE:</b>
        <text>
            |||ltmeta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        </text>
    </bullet>

    <bullet>
        Where is the viewport meta tag placed?
    </bullet>

    <bullet>
        In the html file, in the |||lthead> section.
    </bullet>

    <bullet>
        What are the viewport options?
    </bullet>

    <bullet>
        <ul>
            <li>The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device
                (which will vary depending on the device).
            </li>
            <li>The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by
                the browser.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h1 id="media_rule">The @media rule</h1>

    <bullet>
        Once the viewport is set, how is the Media Query invoked?
    </bullet>

    <bullet>
        Media queries are invoke by the <b>@media</b> rule in the CSS file. <br/>
        The @media rule is used in media queries to apply different styles for different media types/devices.
    </bullet>

    <bullet>
        <b>EXAMPLE:</b><br/>
        <text tid="t1"></text>
    </bullet>

        <b>CSS Syntax:</b><br/>

    <h1 id="breakpoints">Breakpoints</h1>

    <bullet>
        What are Breakpoints?
    </bullet>

    <bullet>
        CSS breakpoints are points where the website content responds according to the device width, allowing you
        to show the best possible layout to the user. They are also called media query breakpoints, as they are
        used with media query.
    </bullet>

    <bullet>
        <img class="lg-img" src="resource/images/css-breakpoints-layouts-01.jpg" alt="Third HTML CSS Image"/>
    </bullet>

    <bullet>
        They are called breakpoints because traditionally major layout elements are broken and repositioned at
        these widths. Although this did not always happen, the name stuck.
    </bullet>

    <bullet>
        The breakpoints are set by the mediafeature in the @media rule.
    </bullet>

    <bullet>
        <b>EXAMPLES:</b><br/>
        <text>
            @media screen and (min-width:576px) { /* ... */ }
        </text>
        In this rule, a breakpoint is set at the width of 576px. Any time the screen width drops below 576px,
        this rule would no longer apply.
        <text>
            @media screen and (min-width:960px) and (max-width:1200px) { /* ... */ }
        </text>
        This rule applies to any width greater than 960px and less than 1200px.

    <h1 id="mobile_first_approach">Mobile First Approach</h1>

    <bullet>
        What is Mobile First Approach?
    </bullet>

    <bullet>
        A mobile first approach to writing CSS means writing your default styling for a mobile device, then using
        media queries to change the layout based on larger devices. This approach works well because you will
        always support mobile and can build up from there. Working larger first usually introduces complications
        trying to break a design down to fit.
