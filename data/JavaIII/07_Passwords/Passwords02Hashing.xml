    <h1>Hash It Out</h1>
    <bullet>
        The best practice for handling users credentials is by hashing their passwords.
    </bullet>
    <bullet>
        What is hashing?
    </bullet>
    <bullet>
        How is hashing different from encrypting?
    </bullet>
    <bullet>
        Hashing is applying an irreversible mathematical function to an input string to produce an output string.
    </bullet>
    <bullet>
        Why is it important that the function is irreversible?
    </bullet>
    <bullet>
        A reversible function is called encryption.
    </bullet>
    <bullet>
        In contrast to encryption, once you hash something, the original input value cannot be retrieved.
    </bullet>
    <bullet>
        So how is it useful, if the password can not be retrieved?
    </bullet>
    <bullet>
        Using fancy mathematical means, we can verify that two hashes came from the same original input.
    </bullet>
    <bullet>
        You can't take a smoothie and get back the original ingredients, but, given two different smoothies, you can
        tell if they came from the same ingredients.
